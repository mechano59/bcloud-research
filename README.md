## Installation
Check out my [postgres installation overview](https://github.com/phase7/bcloud-research/blob/phase7-install-postgres/install-postgres-manjaro.md) to see how I installed on Manjaro.

Below we will look at some of the most useful commands of postgres command line tool.

## Postgres Shell
We can get into the shell by executing psql command. We will likely see our default user name. in this shell we can run the following commands to inspect database and execute  tasks. (will update as I go on)

| Commands  | What they do                                                |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| \q        | quit psql                                                   |
| \i FILE   | execute commands from file                                  |
| \d        | list tables, views, and sequences                           |
| \d TABLENAME| Show table schema and other details of `TABLENAME` table                                  |
| \l        | list databases                                              |
| \c DBNAME | connect to new database DBNAME (currently default username) |
| \x        | Expand view; To see long table records in a beautiful manner|

## Basic SQL (common operations and keywords)

Following are some basic sql commands for beginners. (will update as I go on)
